Thank You, Lucky Stars!
A Cosmic Misadventure

All the way zoomed in, Captain Lucky, space bobbing gif.


Well, Captain?

What a fine kettle of fish you've gotten yourself into this time.

No ship. No crew. No riches. No adventure.
Not even an actual, non-metaphorical fish. Which would at least take the edge off.

Alas, there's only you, alone with your thoughts. Drifting in this endless, glimmering void.

...

Where did it all start, you can't help but wonder?

When was it that the adventure of Captain Lucky Stars began to take this ironic, misfortunate turn?

Everyone knows Black Cats are unlucky. But not everyone knows that, when you accumulate enough bad luck? When it gets so far into the negatives that mathematics can't handle it anymore? It turns out that your luck flips all the way back around into the positives.
